# tech-blog by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog. The challenge consists of creating a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
